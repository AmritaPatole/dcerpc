DCE/RPC
-------

This project is a fork of the Likewise DCE/RPC renovation.

The Likewise git repository is available here:
    git://git.likewisesoftware.com/likewise-open.git

Build notes.
------------

The build system for DCE/RPC is relatively complex, partly due to
the use of automake and libtool and partly because it does a lot
of code generation.

Xcode does not support this sort of thing particularly well, so we
make heavy use of shell script build phases and "workarounds".

Our basic approach to cross-compilation is to separate the build
into two phases. We have a dceidl project that builds the IDL
compiler and installs it into the SDK. Then we have the dcerpc
project that builds the DCERPC framework using the previously
installed IDL compiler.

The dcerpc and dceidl projects should typically by run with different
build architectures, since dceidl is expected to run on the uild
host, and dcerpc is expected to run on the target host. Inside
Apple, the build group has all this preconfigured.

We assume that the IDL compiler is actually an IDL cross-compiler.
This assumption is valid because the autotools build system uses
the "generic" architecture, and everything that depends on the
target architecture is determined at compilation time without the
use of autoconf tests.

We do use autoconf tests to select available features when we are
building the DCERPC framework, and this relies on the fact that
features vary between target SDKs, but not between target architectures.
You can only target a single SDK, and within that SDK, the feature
set is constant, and indepednent of the suported architecture.
Therefore it is valid to do a single configure pass followed by a
multi-architecture build.
