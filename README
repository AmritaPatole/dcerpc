Build notes.
------------

The build system for DCE/RPC is relatively complex, partly due to
the use of automake and libtool and partly because it does a lot
of code generation.

The automake and libtool issues are generally caused by a lack of
support for Darwin in these tools. They don't really understand how
dylibs work, and they certainly don't understand how multi-architecture
builds ought to work.

The code generation is a problem because it means that the autoconf
cross-compilation mechanism needs special sauce to work. There is
no such special sauce in the DCE/RPC build system. For cross-compilation
to work, we would need to build dceidl for the host system and for
the target system. The one we build for the host system would need
to be an IDL cross-compiler, generating c code suitable for th
target system. Until this mechanism is available, we can't build
ppc on i386 or vice versa.

So we can really only support multi-arch builds on i386 and x86_64,
because we use the "generic" RPC architecture, which pulls definitions
from stdint.h. However, we still can't allow the cross-compilation
support to engage, so we have to pass the architcture flags in
CFLAGS. This means that for everything to work right, we need to
clobber CFLAGS in the top-level makefile and ignore that flags that
configure detects.
