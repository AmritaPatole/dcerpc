## Open Group documentation

The primary source for normative documentation is the Open Group.

[C706](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/) is the
promary specification for DCE/RPC 1.1. This document describes
the concepts, protocol and internal mechanisms of the RPC
architecture.

The Open Group also has the
[DCE 1.2.2 documentation set](http://www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/t151x.htm)
available for purchase. This contains some useful RPC
information, particularly in the Application Development Guide.

## Microsoft documentation

Since DCE/RPC is the basis for Windows RPC implementation,
Microsoft provide a lot of useful documentation.

Windows extensions to the DCE/RPC protocols are documented in
[MS-RPCE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc243560.aspx).

The
[Remote Procedure
Call](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378651.aspx)
section of MSDN provides a wealth of information about the Windows
RPC implementation.

The O'Reilly
[Microsoft RPC programming guide](http://openlibrary.org/books/OL555525M/Microsoft_RPC_programming_guide)
is a nice introduction to RPC programming on Windows. Most of it
can be directly applied to DCE/RPC just by changing the function
names.

## Other documentation

The [RPC Internals](/documentation/rpc-internals.pdf) document is
dated and incomplete, but provides a useful insight into some of
the source code architecture and conventions.
